# OurCharacters Project

## Description:

The OurCharacters project is the core of the OurInput initiative, focused on building the tools and infrastructure necessary for users to define, create, and manage their own digital characters and symbols. This project will explore novel ways to represent and store character data, independent of traditional character sets, and provide interfaces for users to design their custom glyphs.

## Motivation:

The current digital landscape often restricts our ability to express ourselves fully due to limitations in available character sets. Whether it's a specialized technical symbol, a unique artistic glyph, or a character from a less common script, the process of incorporating new characters is often cumbersome or impossible.

OurCharacters is driven by the motivation to break free from these constraints. We believe that the power to define and use new characters should reside with the user. This project aims to build a system where individuals and communities can easily create their own digital character molds, enabling richer and more personalized communication. We envision a future where digital text is not limited by pre-defined character sets but can evolve and adapt to the diverse needs of its users.
